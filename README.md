## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge is to build out this CLONE OF FINOLOGY DASHBOARD and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
- Directly go to the different pages when user clink on the buttons

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries and responsive design
- JavaScript functions and DOM events
- Regular expresions(RegEx)


### What I learned

The project's layout is quite intricate due to the inclusion of cards and images. My first lesson from this project was on designing a layout that integrates images and cards effectively, and my second lesson was on implementing transitions on elements.
